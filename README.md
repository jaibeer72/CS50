# CS50

## What is happening here ? 

Answer: Basically I am trying to understand Web Development using Harvard CS50 web module. 

## Does this mean i don't know how to do basic Web Dev ?

Answer: Quite the contrary i am just trying to strengthen my basics so that the complected things delta with soon do not get
        too burdening.

## How are you naming the branches ? 

Answer: Basically module bases if i am extensively working on a module or trying to work on problem statements i will have a branch            for it. I will try keep all the branches to lower cases for example 
        ```git 
        git branch css/bootstrap/row-minipulation
        #template
        git branch main-module/attribute-name
        ```
        nothing too complex.
